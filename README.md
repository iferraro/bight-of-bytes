# **Bight of Bytes**
#### *by Isaac Ferraro, Shawn Park, and Abigail Johnson*


### Bight of Bytes helps you with your next new phone purchase. Compare prices and storage options for your new device. View how much you're paying for your storage option compared to other models!

###### This a proof-of-concept idea made into an app. We believe that Bight of Bytes has the potential to grow exponentially as it gets more developed.
